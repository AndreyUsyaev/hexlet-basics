As is tradition, we'll start by writing a 'Hello, World!' program. The program will print the following text:

![Alt Text](./assets/dart.png)

![Alt Text 2](./assets/javascript.png)

<pre class='hexlet-basics-output'>
  Hello, World!
</pre>

To print something, you need to give computer a special command. In JavaScript, we use `console.log()`.
